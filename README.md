#  CodeJudge - AI-Powered Online Judge Platform

**CodeJudge** is a full-stack, scalable, microservices-based **AI-powered online judge system** that transforms traditional problem-solving into an intelligent, user-friendly experience. It incorporates **LangChain**, **Zod**, and **AWS services** for intelligent assistance and efficient code evaluation.

## Architecture Overview

This project is structured into three microservices, each handling a distinct concern for modularity and scalability:

| Microservice | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `client/`    | Frontend built using React + Tailwind CSS. Hosted on **Vercel**. |
| `src/`       | Backend built with Node.js/Express, dockerized, and utilizes **Nginx** with **Certbot** SSL. |
| `compiler/`  | Isolated code compilation service with language support (C++, Python), containerized via Docker. |

## üåü Features

###  AI-Powered Enhancements
- **Debug Suggestions** via LangChain
- ** Hint Generation** powered by **LangChain** + **Zod** for schema validation

### Problem-Solving
- Real-time **code execution** and **verdict system**
- Upload, manage, and test problems with **S3-based** test case storage
- Boilerplates for problems related to Linked List
- **Leaderboard** and **submission history**
- Contest system (üöß *In Progress*)

### üë• Community Features
- **Discussion threads** stored in **AWS DynamoDB**
- Smart responses and AI moderation features (to be added)

### üõ°Ô∏è Authentication & Security
- Session-based authentication using **Passport.js**
- Backend secured via **HTTPS** using **Certbot + Nginx**

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Infrastructure
- **MongoDB Atlas** for core data storage
- **AWS S3** for test cases
- **AWS ECR** to store production Docker images
- Fully **Dockerized backend & compiler** services
- **Internal Docker network** for secure inter-service communication

---

##  Deployment Details

### üåê Frontend (`client`)
- Built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**
- Deployed on **Vercel**
- Dynamically fetches backend endpoints from environment variables

### üß† Backend (`src`)
- Dockerized Node.js/Express server
- Serves authentication, problem management, and user operations
- Proxied through **Nginx**
- SSL enabled via **Let's Encrypt (Certbot)**
- Communicates with MongoDB, S3, DynamoDB, and Compiler service

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compiler (`compiler`)
- Docker-based secure sandbox environment
- Supports code execution for:
  - **C++**
  - **Python**
- Connected with backend through internal Docker networking
- Language extensibility possible
